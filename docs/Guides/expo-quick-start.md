# Expo Quick Start

If you want to kick the tires, [Expo](https://expo.dev/) is a great option. You can spin up a React Native project with very little setup.

This page will walk you through getting setup with Expo and React Native Zephyr.

## Step 1: Create a project

Using `expo-cli`, you can quickly create an expo project:

```shell
npx expo-cli init [yourProjectName]
```

:::tip
At the Expo CLI prompt, choose one of the TypeScript templates to get the most out of Zephyr.

## Step 2: Tell Expo to Allow Dark Mode

In your Expo project, you should see an `app.json` file that configures various aspects of your Expo app. Set `expo.userInterfaceStyle` to `"automatic"` in this file.

## Step 3: Get started with Zephyr

Head on over to [the Quick Start guide](../quick-start.md) to add Zephyr to your new Expo project.
